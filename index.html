<p> When the first World Cup arrived in the US in the 90's everyone officially declared that soccer was it. Well it's taken it's time but we can definitely see the influence of soccer, especially women's soccer, across the US. This year, 3 million kids played in youth soccer leagues with 2/3 of those leagues for girls. In fact, in the 12-17 age range the MLS has surpassed the MLB and NFL in popularity.
